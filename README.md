# MC_3D_IWT

Meaningful ciphertext color image encryption based on 3D-IWT and 2D-ICSM Hyperchaos

The code runs on Matlab 2015b and the image encryption and decryption are achieved by running the main1 function directly.

Modifying the plaintext and cover path can be modified in the following two codes.
# im = double(imread('date512/1.bmp'))
# cover = double(imread('date512/2.bmp'))
